# handwritten-digit-recognizer
This project involves the development of a handwritten digit recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) implemented with Keras. The goal is to accurately classify images of handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset. The model is trained to recognize patterns and features in the digits, achieving high accuracy in prediction.
